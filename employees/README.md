# Employee-Directory

## Description

With this Employee Directory App, the user will be able to view their entire employee directory at once so that they have quick access to their information. When the page is loaded, the information for all of their employees is populated onto the page. 

The user may sort the table by First Name, Last Name, or Age. It is also possible to search for any user in the table by First Name, Last Name, Age, Email or Phone Number. As you type and begin your search, the table will filter to show you the users whose information matches that which you've typed in.
